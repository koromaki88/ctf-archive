When the ritual failed and the last flame died, the clan elders locked their shame inside a book of mistakes - the Codex of Failures. Each error it records is a lie that almost happened. You have found the codex locked behind a malevolent spell. Kuromaru's voice is hidden there; only by reading failures correctly can you force the ancient book to confess a secret vital to your journey's success.
