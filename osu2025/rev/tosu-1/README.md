# tosu-1 - 17 solves / 265 pts

Welcome to the first part of the series of tosu challenges.

Full clear the attached map scoring only 300s.

Note: If your solver isn't working and you're confident that it seems correct but still can't get the flag, try achieving the perfect score with no reflection of it in the GUI. Essentially, you should have a perfect score without ever touching the circles, and the counts on the final screen should all be zero except the miss count, which should be 1080. (It will make sense if you're stuck in that place)

expected difficulty: 3/5
