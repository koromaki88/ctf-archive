Something is not quite right if you look at the beatmap page... Did I forget to clean my footprint?

Note: This challenge ONLY requires you to inspect the mapset page (i.e. any stuff under https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/x/...). Do NOT interact with forum or post anything outside.

This is an OSINT challenge.

expected difficulty: 2/5
